# ⚠️ Important: SQLite Limitation on Vercel

## The Problem
Vercel uses **serverless functions** which are stateless. This means:
- ❌ SQLite database files **won't persist** between function calls
- ❌ Data is lost after each request
- ❌ Your current SQLite setup **won't work** on Vercel

## ✅ Solution: Use a Cloud Database

For Vercel deployment, you need to replace SQLite with one of these:

### Option 1: Use Render Instead (Easiest!)
**Render supports SQLite perfectly:**
- ✅ Free tier
- ✅ SQLite works out of the box
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Data persists

**Recommendation**: Deploy to **Render** instead of Vercel!

### Option 2: Convert to Supabase (For Vercel)

If you specifically want Vercel, migrate to Supabase:

#### Step 1: Create Supabase Account
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create free account
3. Create a new project

#### Step 2: Install Supabase
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

#### Step 3: Get Credentials
- In Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings > API**
- Copy **Project URL** and **anon key**

#### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Create `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

#### Step 5: Rewrite Database Layer
You'll need to:
- Replace SQLite with Supabase client
- Update all database operations
- Migrate schema to Supabase

**This requires significant code changes!**

### Option 3: Use PostgreSQL with Vercel

Similar to Supabase but more manual:
1. Use Vercel Postgres (paid feature)
2. Or use Railway PostgreSQL with Vercel
3. Rewrite database layer

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

### Best Option: Deploy to Render
1. SQLite works perfectly
2. No code changes
3. Free tier
4. Easy deployment

### If You Must Use Vercel:
1. Choose a cloud database (Supabase recommended)
2. Plan 3-4 hours for migration
3. Rewrite database layer
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy

## Need Help?

- **Want easy deployment?** → Use **Render**
- **Want Vercel?** → Use **Supabase**
- **Questions?** → Check the documentation files

**Bottom line**: Your current app with SQLite is **NOT compatible** with Vercel's serverless architecture. Choose a platform that supports file storage (Render, Railway) or migrate to a cloud database.
